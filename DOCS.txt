How Werehouse working : 

*  It is a subject-oriented , integrated , time-variant , and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process .

    - Subject oriented : focus on business area (sales , customers , finance)
    - Integrated : cause it goes and integrates multiple source systems . (for multiple sources)
    - Time-variant : you can keep historical data inside the data werehouse 
    - Non-volatile : oance the data enter the data werehouse , it is not deleted or modified .

System -> Data Analyst (collect and extract the data - transforming that in some miningful) -> Share reports (XL's , PowerPoints , etc..) => It takes too long (Weeks , Months)

BigData - when it becomes impossible to collect the data by hand 

Now you can start to use ETL (Extract , Transform and Load)  - process to extract the data from the sources and apply multiple transformations , collecting the data in Werehouse (already with all type of reports)

Developers : 

Data Engineer - Builds the ETL component and the data Werehouse
Data Analyst - Consuming the data werehouse , building different data models and reports
