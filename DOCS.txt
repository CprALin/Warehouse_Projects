How Werehouse working : 

*  It is a subject-oriented , integrated , time-variant , and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process .

    - Subject oriented : focus on business area (sales , customers , finance)
    - Integrated : cause it goes and integrates multiple source systems . (for multiple sources)
    - Time-variant : you can keep historical data inside the data werehouse 
    - Non-volatile : oance the data enter the data werehouse , it is not deleted or modified .

System -> Data Analyst (collect and extract the data - transforming that in some miningful) -> Share reports (XL's , PowerPoints , etc..) => It takes too long (Weeks , Months)

BigData - when it becomes impossible to collect the data by hand 

Now you can start to use ETL (Extract , Transform and Load)  - process to extract the data from the sources and apply multiple transformations , collecting the data in Werehouse (already with all type of reports)

Developers : 

Data Engineer - Builds the ETL component and the data Werehouse
Data Analyst - Consuming the data werehouse , building different data models and reports 


ETL's : 

ETL - Process 
Extract data from the source (subset of data) -> Transform the data (manipulate) / Reshape -> Load (Final destination - target)

ETL methods : 
We need to pull or push data to the Werehouse .

Extract techniques : Manual Data Extraction , Database Querying , File Parsing , API Calls , Event Based Streaming , CDC (change data capture) , Web Scraping 
Transformation techniques : -> Data Integration , Data Enrichment , Data Normalization & Standardization ,  Bussines Rules & Locig , Aggregations 
                            -> Data Cleansing : Removes duplicates , Hnadling Invaid Values , Missing data , Unwanted space Data Type Casting
Load techniques : -> Processing type - Batch (in one step to load everything) , Stream (live changes - real time data werehouse)
                  -> Load methods : * Full load : Drop , Create , Insert
                                    *
